# Chapter 8: Incorporating Data

Data is the lifeblood of our applications. It flows like water, and it nourishes our components with value. The user interface components we've composed are vessels for data. We fill our applications with data from the internet. We collect, create, and send new data to the internet. The value of our applications is not the components themselvesâ€”it's the data that flows through those components.
